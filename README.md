What does a team generator do? A team generator allows you to add and take away a member of your team, it also allows you to create teams. 

ON STARTUP
When the program is initiated in the command line, the user will be prompted with questions including the name id and email of the person your adding to your team. 
The program will then go through the other people in your team and ask for their descriptions. 
Once these descriptions are filled out the program will take that information and generate an HTML file with it displaying the information with cards creating specific cards for 
each person and creating links to their information.
